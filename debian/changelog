ros-hydro-stereo-wall-detection (1.0.1-0raring) raring; urgency=high

  * Added install targets
  * Generate changelogs
  * Now compiles in hydro
  * Fixed detector include
  * Fixed export targets
  * Added include export
  * Fixing linking
  * Catkinization and hydro compilation
  * Packagexml
  * catkinize
  * Update plugs launch files; fix error in pcl wall extractor
  * count points in cloud
  * stay subscribed to cloud messages
  * update stack dependencies
  * working with fuerte
  * eigen port
  * Fix indeterminate wall normal and add debugging output.
  * Fix use of Eigen3 in transforms.
  * port to pcl
  * port to eigen3
  * patching for Eigen3 compatability
  * Do not kill app when one of the nodes dies. This allows apps to take advantage of the respawn function in roslaunch to be more robust.
  * another attempt to fix the segfaults
  * Hopefully, fixing the stero wall plane detector once and for all, we'll see how it goes
  * copy branch into trunk
